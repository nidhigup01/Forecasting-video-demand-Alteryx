The Business Problem
You recently started working for a company as a supply chain analyst that creates and sells video games. Many businesses have to be on point when it comes to ordering supplies to meet the demand of its customers. An overestimation of demand leads to bloated inventory and high costs. Underestimating demand means many valued customers won't get the products they want. Your manager has tasked you to forecast monthly sales data in order to synchronize supply with demand, aid in decision making that will help build a competitive infrastructure and measure company performance. You, the supply chain analyst, are assigned to help your manager run the numbers through a time series forecasting model.

You’ve been asked to provide a forecast for the next 4 months of sales and report your findings.

Steps to Success
Step 1: Investigate and Prepare the Data
Look at your data set and determine whether the data is appropriate to use time series models. Determine which records should be held for validation later on.

Step 2: Determine Trend, Seasonal and Error components
Graph the data set and decompose the time series into its three main components: trend, seasonality, and error.

Step 3: Build your Models
Determine the appropriate measurements to apply to your ARIMA and ETS models and describe the errors for both models.

Step 4: Forecast
Compare the in-sample error measurements to both models and compare error measurements for the holdout sample in your forecast. Choose the best fitting model and forecast the next four periods.

HINT:

When adding in the ACF and PACF plots, you should put in the original plots in your report and then after each term is added to the model include the resulting ACF and PACF plots. This helps us see the progression of why you are choosing the terms you are. Do not forget to include the plots after the final term that you determine is needed for the model as well. Be careful when plotting that you are selecting the new data you created after doing any differencing.


Review
Use the project rubric to review your project. If you are happy with your submission, then you're ready to submit your project. If you see room for improvement, keep working to improve your project.

Submission Template
Use the submission template at the bottom of this section to submit your project. After filling it out, save it as a PDF and submit the PDF in the next section. You may also include your Alteryx workflow if you'd like. If your submission does not meet specifications, having the workflow may help the review identify mistakes.

Project List
This is here to make it easier for you to assess if your project is close to passing so you can try debugging your workflow and project before submission. If you do not feel confident in the topics addressed please review the course material or reach out on the forums, slack, or on a one on one!

Task List












Since the models are going to be forecasting 4 periods we only need to use a holdout sample of 4 periods. Be sure to bring in all the data after determining which model performs better in your final prediction.
